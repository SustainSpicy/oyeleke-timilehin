===============================================
Redundant Sorting and Filtering:

The sortedBalances array is created using useMemo,
which sorts and filters the balances array based on the blockchain property.
However, the filtering logic is redundant, as it checks for lhsPriority which is not defined in the code block. It seems like there's a typographical error; it should be balancePriority.
The filtering logic also returns true for balance.amount <= 0,
but this condition is not used in the subsequent code. If this condition is not necessary,
it leads to unnecessary computations.

===============================================
Inefficient Mapping:

The sortedBalances array is mapped twice: first to create formattedBalances and then to create rows. This results in iterating over the same array twice, which can be avoided.

===============================================
Inefficient Usage of Objects:

The useMemo hook recalculates sortedBalances whenever balances or prices change. If balances or prices are large objects, recalculating this array on every change can be computationally expensive.

===============================================
Inefficient Key Usage:

The key prop in the WalletRow component is set to the index of the map function. Using the index as a key can lead to issues with component reordering and is not recommended for dynamic lists.

===============================================
Inefficient String Formatting:

String formatting using toFixed() might not be efficient for large numbers. It can lead to precision issues, especially with financial calculations. Consider using a more robust library for handling currency formatting.

===============================================
Unused getPriority Function:

The getPriority function is defined but not used in the code. This can be removed to improve code readability.

===============================================
Lack of Error Handling:

There is no error handling for potential issues, such as missing properties in the balances or prices objects. Proper error handling should be implemented to handle unexpected data structures.
